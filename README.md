# TCG_Portal
This is a simple starter website that uses HTML and CSS that shows images of cards along with their description. This is a way to look at cards in smaller sizes, when clicking the card you can see the description of the card including the market price that is in this year.

# Installation
This is a simple website that can be run in Visual Studio as well as others that can use HTML. This is a website where you can add the cards you like. I only added a few since this was an example. You will see 2 style sheets one is for the signup page and the other is made for everything else including the sizes of the cards and the fonts as well. When you see a '#' this is where you need to add the URL where it should be shown when running the site copy and paste the URL you see when running it in Google or other websites it pops in and everything should be able to run.
